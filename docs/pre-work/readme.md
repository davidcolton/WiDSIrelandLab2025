# Pre-work

The labs in this workshop are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The notebooks can be run on your computer or remotely on the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) service. Check out [Running the Granite Notebooks](#running-the-granite-notebooks) section on how to setup the way you want to run the notebooks.

## Running the Granite Notebooks

The notebooks can be run:

- [Locally on your computer](#running-the-granite-notebooks-locally) OR
- [Remotely on the Google Colab service](#running-the-granite-notebooks-remotely-colab)

Follow the instructions in one of the sections that follow on how you would like to run the notebooks.

## Running the Granite Notebooks Locally

It is recommended if you want to run the lab notebooks locally on your computer that you have:

- A computer or laptop
- Knowledge of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Running the lab notebooks locally on your computer requires the following steps:

## Local Prerequisites

- Git
- Uv

### Git

Git can be installed on the most common operating systems like Windows,  Mac, and Linux. In fact, Git comes installed by default on most Mac and  Linux machines!

For comprehensive instructions on how to install `git` on your laptop please refer to the [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) page.

To confirm the you have `git` installed correctly you can open a terminal window and type `git version`. You should receive a response like the one shown below.

```shell
git version
git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)
```

### Uv

`uv` is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

For detailed instructions on how to install `uv` on your laptop please refer to the [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installing-uv) page.

To confirm the you have `uv` installed correctly you can open a terminal window and type `uv --version`. You should receive a response like the one shown below.

```shell
uv --version
uv 0.6.12 (e4e03833f 2025-04-02)
```

## Clone the Granite Workshop Repository

Clone the workshop repo and cd into the repo directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/WiDSIreland/WiDSIrelandLab2025
cd sample-wids
```

### Sync the Python Virtual Environment

The Sample WiDS repository uses a `pyproject.toml` file to define the version of Python to use and the required libraries to load. To sync your repository and setup Python and download the library dependancies run `uv sync` in a terminal. After syncing you have to activate your virtual environment.

**Note:**

If running on Windows it is suggested that you use the Windows Powershell running as administrator or, if you have it installed, the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

```shell
uv sync

# Mac & Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows Powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Serving the Granite AI Models

[Lab 1: Document Summarization with Granite](../lab-1/readme.md) and [Lab 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Langchain](../lab-2/readme.md) require Granite models to be served by an AI model runtime so that the models can be invoked or called. There are 2 options to serve the models as follows:

- [Replicate AI Cloud Platform](#replicate-ai-cloud-platform)
- [Running Ollama Locally](#running-ollama-locally) OR

#### Replicate AI Cloud Platform

[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) is a cloud platform that will host and serve AI models for you.

1. Create a [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) account. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to do this.

1. Add credit to your Replicate Account (optional). To remove a barrier to entry to try the Granite models on the Replicate platform, use [this link](https://replicate.com/invites/a8717bfe-2f3d-4a52-88ed-1356231cdf03) to add a small amount of credit to your Replicate account.

1. Create a Replicate [API Token](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).

1. When you run the sample Notebooks you will be prompted to enter this token.

1. Alternatively you can set your Replicate API Token as an environment variable in your terminal where you will run the notebook:

    ```shell
    export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your_replicate_api_token>
    ```

#### Running Ollama Locally

If you want to run the AI models locally on your computer, you can use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). You will need to have a computer with:

- GPU processor
- At least 32GB RAM

!!! note "Tested system"
    This was tested on a Macbook with an M1 processor and 32GB RAM. It maybe possible to serve models with a CPU and less memory.

If you computer is unable to serve the models, then it is recommended to go to the [Replicate AI Cloud Platform](#replicate-ai-cloud-platform) section instead.

Running Ollama locally on your computer requires the following steps:

1. [Download and install Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#ollama), if you haven't already. **Ollama v0.3.14+ is required, so please upgrade if on an earlier version.**

    On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install with

    ```shell
    brew install ollama
    ```

1. Start the Ollama server. You will leave this running during the workshop.

    ```shell
    ollama serve
    ```

1. In another terminal window, pull down the Granite models you will want to use in the workshop. Larger models take more memory to run but can give better results.

    ```shell
    ollama pull granite3.2:2b
    ollama pull granite3.2:8b
    ```

## Running the Granite Notebooks Remotely (Colab)

Running the lab notebooks remotely using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) requires the following steps:

- [Colab Prerequisites](#colab-prerequisites)
- [Serving the Granite AI Models for Colab](#serving-the-granite-ai-models-for-colab)

!!! note "Notebook execution speed tip" The default execution runtime in Colab uses a CPU. Consider using a different Colab runtime to increase execution speed, especially in situations where you may have other constraints such as a slow network connection. From the navigation bar, select `Runtime->Change runtime type`, then select either GPU- or TPU-based hardware acceleration.

### Colab Prerequisites

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) requires a Google account that you're logged into

### Serving the Granite AI Models for Colab

[Lab 1: Document Summarization with Granite](../lab-1/readme.md) and [Lab 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Langchain](../lab-2/readme.md) and  require Granite models to be served by an AI model runtime so that the models can be invoked or called.

#### Replicate AI Cloud Platform for Colab

[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) is a cloud platform that will host and serve AI models for you.

1. Create a [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) account. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to do this.

1. Add credit to your Replicate Account (optional). To remove a barrier to entry to try the Granite Code models on the Replicate platform, use [this link](https://replicate.com/invites/a8717bfe-2f3d-4a52-88ed-1356231cdf03) to add a small amount of credit to your Replicate account.

1. Create a Replicate [API Token](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).

1. Add your Replicate API Token to the Colab Secrets manager to securely store it. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and click on the 🔑 Secrets tab in the left panel. Click "New Secret" and enter `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` as the key, and paste your token into the value field. Toggle the button on the left to allow notebook access to the secret.
